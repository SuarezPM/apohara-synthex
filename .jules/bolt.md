**Learning:** The pipeline fetches and classifies data sequentially, which can be a bottleneck for multi-target or multi-document payloads. Using unbounded `Promise.all()` is a fast fix but could hit rate limits if input sizes are large. Future optimizations should consider chunked concurrent processing.
**Action:** Always check the input size bounds before replacing sequential async loops with unbounded `Promise.all()`.
